# Hey there, I'm Toané👋🏾 A creative developer with a love for design and front-end development.

## 🌱 **My Journey**

In 2021, I graduated with first-class honours in BA Product and Industrial Design. Since then freelanced in Web and Graphic design whilst building my own UX/UI projects in my free time in hopes of having a holistic view of delivering effective user experiences with the websites I develop.  With a web and graphic design background, I've developed my skills in creating aesthetically pleasing, user-friendly interfaces. Transitioning into front-end development, I've embraced the exciting challenges of turning designs into interactive, responsive websites.

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack**

- **Languages:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Design Tools:** Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, Figma)
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

## 🌟 **What I Do**

I specialise in translating design concepts into clean, efficient code. From pixel-perfect layouts to interactive user interfaces, I love being involved from start to end in the design and development process. I'm always exploring new technologies and looking to learn new things every day.
